# Keylogger
# Developed a keylogger in Python that captures keystrokes and reports them remotely via email. 
# The keylogger runs in the background, capturing all keystrokes and saving them to a file or sending them via email at regular intervals. 
# It uses the keyboard library for key capturing and smtplib for email reporting, demonstrating an understanding of keylogging techniques and email automation.
